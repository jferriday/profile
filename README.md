## Profile
Hi, I'm Josh Ferriday. I'm a front-end developer based in Leeds, UK. I am developing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build beautiful websites.

## Skills & Education
I'm always improving my knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** with an aim to build responsive and accessible sites. Recently I've been dipping my toes into **React**. 

### FreeCodeCamp
My initial foray into software development was through the Python course on FreeCodeCamp. While I'm now focused on web development, I've had the opportunity to work with Python and Jupyter notebooks.

### Codecademy
I'm currently working though the Full Stack Engineer course with Codecademy. It had given me exposure to using Git and GitHub, working with Node and NPM, developing responsive sites with HTML and CSS and building interactivity using vanilla JavaScript.
